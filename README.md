# 4310 Group Research Project, Deadlock Detection Alogirthms
#Jackie Fortner, Catherine Johnson, Ada Yang

#This repository contains two demos as a part of our research project on deadlock detection algorithms:

#1. Wait-For Graph(WFG): a variation of a resource allocation graph that handles single instance deadlock detection

#2. Banker's Algorithm(BANKER): a resource allocation/deadlock detection algorithm that prevents deadlock by simulating distribution of resources

#For both demos, our group chose to use Python to implement our algorithms per ease of writing the code and greater readability as we will be using the demos as a part of our presentation.
